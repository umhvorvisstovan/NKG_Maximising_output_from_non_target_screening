abstract = {Quantitative data on product chemical composition is a necessary parameter for characterizing near-field exposure. This data set comprises reported and predicted information on more than 75,000 chemicals and more than 15,000 consumer products. The data's primary intended use is for exposure, risk, and safety assessments. The data set includes specific products with quantitative or qualitative ingredient information, which has been publicly disclosed through material safety data sheets (MSDS) and ingredient lists. A single product category from a refined and harmonized set of categories has been assigned to each product. The data set also contains information on the functional role of chemicals in products, which can inform predictions of the concentrations in which they occur. These data will be useful to exposure and risk assessors evaluating chemical and product safety.},

abstract = {Despite an abundance of online databases providing access to chemical data, there is increasing demand for high-quality, structure-curated, open data to meet the various needs of the environmental sciences and computational toxicology communities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) web-based CompTox Chemistry Dashboard is addressing these needs by integrating diverse types of relevant domain data through a cheminformatics layer, built upon a database of curated substances linked to chemical structures. These data include physicochemical, environmental fate and transport, exposure, usage, in vivo toxicity, and in vitro bioassay data, surfaced through an integration hub with link-outs to additional EPA data and public domain online resources. Batch searching allows for direct chemical identifier (ID) mapping and downloading of multiple data streams in several different formats. This facilitates fast access to available structure, property, toxicity, and bioassay data for collections of chemicals (hundreds to thousands at a time). Advanced search capabilities are available to support, for example, non-targeted analysis and identification of chemicals using mass spectrometry. The contents of the chemistry database, presently containing $\sim$ 760,000 substances, are available as public domain data for download. The chemistry content underpinning the Dashboard has been aggregated over the past 15 years by both manual and auto-curation techniques within EPA's DSSTox project. DSSTox chemical content is subject to strict quality controls to enforce consistency among chemical substance-structure identifiers, as well as list curation review to ensure accurate linkages of DSSTox substances to chemical lists and associated data. The Dashboard, publicly launched in April 2016, has expanded considerably in content and user traffic over the past year. It is continuously evolving with the growth of DSSTox into high-interest or data-rich domains of interest to EPA, such as chemicals on the Toxic Substances Control Act listing, while providing the user community with a flexible and dynamic web-based platform for integration, processing, visualization and delivery of data and resources. The Dashboard provides support for a broad array of research and regulatory programs across the worldwide community of toxicologists and environmental scientists.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

abstract = {Gas chromatography coupled with high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (GC–HR-TOFMS) has gained popularity for the target and suspect analysis of complex samples. However, confident detection of target/suspect analytes in complex samples, such as produced water, remains a challenging task. Here we report on the development and validation of a two stage algorithm for the confident target and suspect analysis of produced water extracts. We performed both target and suspect analysis for 48 standards, which were a mixture of 28 aliphatic hydrocarbons and 20 alkylated phenols, in 3 produced water extracts. The two stage algorithm produces a chemical standard database of spectra, in the first stage, which is used for target and suspect analysis during the second stage. The first stage is carried out through five steps via an algorithm here referred to as unique ion extractor (UIE). During the first step the m/z values in the spectrum of a standard that do not belong to that standard are removed in order to produce a clean spectrum and then during the last step the cleaned spectrum is calibrated. The Dot-product algorithm, during the second stage, uses the cleaned and calibrated spectra of the standards for both target and suspect analysis. We performed the target analysis of 48 standards in all 3 samples via conventional methods, in order to validate the two stage algorithm. The two stage algorithm was demonstrated to be more robust, reliable, and less sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), when compared to the conventional method. The Dot-product algorithm showed lower potential in producing false positives compared to the conventional methods, when dealing with complex samples. We also evaluated the effect of the mass accuracy on the performances of Dot-product algorithm. Our results indicated the crucial importance of HR-MS data and the mass accuracy for confident suspect analysis in complex samples.},

abstract = {This report describes the results of a suspect screening study in samples from city areas in the Nordic countries. In contrast to target analysis, suspect screening starts with a general sample preparation and identification including as much compounds as possible. The resulting list of recorded compounds will be identified by comparison with a list of suspected compounds. Suspect screening has shown to be very useful for identification of emerging environmental pollutants. It was possible to identify: Perfluorinated compounds (PFC), chlorinated and brominated compounds, flame retardants, bisphenols, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), industrial additives, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP). This study was jointly performed by NILU, NIVA, and Ume{\aa} University on behalf of the Nordic Council of Ministers. The study was supervised by the Nordic screening group.},

@article{Schymanski2015,
abstract = {In this article, a dataset from a collaborative non-target screening trial organised by the NORMAN Association is used to review the state-of-the-art and discuss future perspectives of non-target screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry in water analysis. A total of 18 institutes from 12 European countries analysed an extract of the same water sample collected from the River Danube with either one or both of liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection. This article focuses mainly on the use of high resolution screening techniques with target, suspect, and non-target workflows to identify substances in environmental samples. Specific examples are given to emphasise major challenges including isobaric and co-eluting substances, dependence on target and suspect lists, formula assignment, the use of retention information, and the confidence of identification. Approaches and methods applicable to unit resolution data are also discussed. Although most substances were identified using high resolution data with target and suspect-screening approaches, some participants proposed tentative non-target identifications. This comprehensive dataset revealed that non-target analytical techniques are already substantially harmonised between the participants, but the data processing remains time-consuming. Although the objective of a "fully-automated identification workflow" remains elusive in the short term, important steps in this direction have been taken, exemplified by the growing popularity of suspect screening approaches. Major recommendations to improve non-target screening include better integration and connection of desired features into software packages, the exchange of target and suspect lists, and the contribution of more spectra from standard substances into (openly accessible) databases.

@article{Samanipour2018,
abstract = {Nontarget analysis is considered one of the most comprehensive tools for the identification of unknown compounds in a complex sample analyzed via liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Due to the complexity of the data generated via LC-HRMS, the data-dependent acquisition mode, which produces the MS2 spectra of a limited number of the precursor ions, has been one of the most common approaches used during nontarget screening. However, data-independent acquisition mode produces highly complex spectra that require proper deconvolution and library search algorithms. We have developed a deconvolution algorithm and a universal library search algorithm (ULSA) for the analysis of complex spectra generated via data-independent acquisition. These algorithms were validated and tested using both semisynthetic and real environmental data. A total of 6000 randomly selected spectra from MassBank were introduced across the total ion chromatograms of 15 sludge extracts at three levels of background complexity for the validation of the algorithms via semisynthetic data. The deconvolution algorithm successfully extracted more than 60% of the added ions in the analytical signal for 95% of processed spectra (i.e., 3 complexity levels multiplied by 6000 spectra). The ULSA ranked the correct spectra among the top three for more than 95% of cases. We further tested the algorithms with 5 wastewater effluent extracts for 59 artificial unknown analytes (i.e., their presence or absence was confirmed via target analysis). These algorithms did not produce any cases of false identifications while correctly identifying ∼70% of the total inquiries. The implications, capabilities, and the limitations of both algorithms are further discussed.},
